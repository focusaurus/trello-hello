# Trello Hello

## Overview

This is a small command line interface client to show me my trello cards in a compact format. Since trello is generic, it does not understand the semantics of particular boards - for example the fact that the "Done" board should be skipped when showing my to do list.

## Features

* Show cards from multiple boards and lists in a compact format
* Only show cards from boards with names meaning they are pending to dos

## Purpose

This is mostly an exercise to learn some Go stuff. But it is useful to me, too. I'm using the "github.com/go-playground/validator/v10" package because we use it at work and I wanted to understand its basic functionality in a simpler context.

I wanted to understand the pattern of a library exporting a struct and the application code that uses the library defines an interface for the subset of the external API actually used in this application, and that interface supports mocking for unit tests.
